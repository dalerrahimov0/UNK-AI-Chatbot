#### Requirements

The Admitted Incoming Freshman Scholarship Application is the primary application for first-time freshmen UNK scholarships. It's available in students' MyBLUE from August 1 to March 1, and becomes accessible only after being admitted to UNK. By completing this single application, students are considered for most scholarships. However, some scholarships require a separate application, which can be accessed from the list below.

First-time freshmen are automatically considered for renewable merit scholarships at UNK based on their GPA (grade point average), transcripts, and ACT/SAT scores. To be eligible, by March 1 you must be admitted to UNK, and we must receive your high school transcripts and scores. If you have a 3.7+ GPA, your information will be reviewed for one of the following scholarships:

Awards are based on the cumulative GPA at the end of your sixth semester (junior year) and are converted to a 4.0 scale. Terms and conditions for each scholarship are linked above. Award amounts are determined based on the year of the student's initial enrollment. Please refer to your offer letter, which will be sent beginning October 1, for specific details and renewal conditions.

Other scholarships, award amounts, deadlines, and requirements are shown below.
