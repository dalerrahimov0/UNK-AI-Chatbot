## Welcome to UNK

### From Charlie Bicak



Welcome to UNK.

We are a community of people focused on the future. We want to help students achieve their goals, and we are committed to the well-being of communities across Nebraska. I invite you to visit campus, and feel the collective enthusiasm of UNK, Kearney, and central Nebraska.

UNK has tremendous momentum. I have seen UNK grow over time, starting from my own undergraduate education here in the 1970s, then as a faculty member in the 1990s, and then as the Senior Vice Chancellor in the 2000s. I love this place, and I’m very proud of it.

UNK has top-quality academic programs that give students a broad foundation for a lifetime of growth, and specialization in their field of choice that will help them land that first job. Our faculty members are active scholars in their fields, and they’ll bring excitement to the learning environment.

The campus has new residential buildings, a new STEM building, and a vibrant University Village coming together. Our partners from the University of Nebraska Medical Center deliver top-quality healthcare programs on our campus, including nursing, allied health, and coming in fall of 2025 we’ll add medicine, pharmacy, and public health. We will soon be home to the largest rural health education facility in the country.

All this comes together to make us one of only two Best Value public institutions in the Midwest region. We deliver world class education at a price that Nebraskans can afford. We are a regional university that serves the people of central Nebraska, the entire state, the Great Plains, and indeed, the nation and the globe.

Future students, explore our offerings online, and get to know us. You can tell us a little about what you’re looking for, and we will develop a customized experience for you here on our website. Better yet, come visit. We’ll show you how the programs, people, and experiences here at UNK set you up for your best future.
