## Title IX

Title IX provides the standards for institutions receiving complaints of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating and domestic violence along with stalking. UNK is dedicated to the prevention of sexual discrimination, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct, and providing a safe campus for its employee and students.

What is Title IX?

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. .1681 et seq.) prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs receiving Federal financial assistance. Athletics are considered an integral part of an institution's education program and are therefore covered by this law.

Title IX states:  "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."

Who does Title IX apply to?

Title IX applies to all educational institutions, both public and private, that receive federal funds. This means all students, faculty and staff are protected by Title IX.

Who is responsible for enforcing Title IX?

Compliance with Title IX is a shared responsibility of an entire institution, from top-level administration to individual staff members. Institutions are required to investigate any complaints of gender discrimination. In addition, all students and employees must be notified of the name, office address and telephone number of the designated Title IX coordinator.
