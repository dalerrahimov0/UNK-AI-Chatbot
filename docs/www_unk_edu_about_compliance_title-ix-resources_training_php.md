### Training Materials for Title IX Team

As part of its commitment to creating a safe and respectful learning environment, the University of Nebraska at Kearney is launching a new Title IX training program that focuses on sexual misconduct prevention and response.  All UNK faculty, staff and students are required to complete sexual misconduct prevention education each year.

The training modules were developed by Catharsis Productions, a Chicago-based training and education organization whose staff includes individuals who have worked in violence prevention education and have served as victim advocates. Sensitive topics within the modules are addressed in a frank and engaging manner.

UNK recognizes that some of these topics are sensitive in nature and may trigger an emotional response. Please practice positive self-care and seek resources that may assist you. View additional resources and support services.
