## Accreditation

### Program Accreditation



The University of Nebraska at Kearney (UNK) is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC).

HLC is a national accrediting organization for degree-granting post-secondary institutions in the United States. The University of Nebraska at Kearney has been accredited continuously by HLC (and its forerunner, the North Central Association) since 1916.Â UNK is fully accredited by HLC through 2033.

HLC accreditation applies to the entire institution. It includes all programs and all locations.



In addition to the institutional accreditation, many UNK academic programs have sought and been awarded accreditation specific to their degree offerings. Accredited programs meet rigorous standards of academic quality.

These standards include factors such as professional attainments of faculty; quality of research; library holdings; physical facilities; and general funding support for the respective programs. As a result, students can be assured their educational experiences at UNK will meet high standards of quality.
