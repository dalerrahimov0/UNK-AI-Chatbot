The Honors Program is dedicated to working with our faculty to provide an Honors experience for the students. The purpose of the Honors Program is to challenge students to go above and beyond* by fostering intellectual curiosity. The faculty on this campus helps us accomplish this.

*Above and beyond is defined as students stretching and reaching beyond the norms of the classroom or project.

I will be researching an issue that occurred in my hometown with a company trying to buy land and use it as a nuclear waste dumping area. I will interview 3 people that were involved in the policy decisions and look at local law to tie into the ideas/concepts in the classroom. Outcome: Presentation to the class.

I am creating an additional research report that will focus on the connection to research regarding “the states” as laboratories of constitutional experimentation. I will be using concepts that are discussed throughout the semester to complete this project. This outcome will be a a final paper. I would also like to extend this further for an additional H-option that would result in a regional presentation or peer-led research discussion. I have also explored ideas with presenting this work to future classes or clubs.

- An H-option is a small, independent project that moves an Honors student above and beyond the course.
- An H-option should add value to both the Honors student’s pathway and the course.
- To start the discussion with a faculty member, an Honors student should come prepared with an idea of a project or topic.
- A faculty member should consider any project with a clear, defined outcome that a hard-working Honors student can complete, satisfactorily, in 15 to 20 hours of time outside of class.
- Faculty members are not required to do H-options; depending on the project, the Honors student or faculty member may decide it is not a good fit for the class.
- H-options can happen inside or outside of the course.

- Appropriate outcomes for an H-option are a paper (all types, dependent on field), presentation (audience can be variable depending on topic), exhibit, performance, poster, peer-faculty discussion, peer-led discussion, lab report, analysis, observation combined with reporting, portfolio, video, works of art, design mock-up, etc.
- An H-option contract is due to the Honors office by Week 6 of the fall/spring semesters. The Honors student is responsible for submitting this contract. In summer, this contract will be due by the 1st week of a summer course.

An H-option contract describes the work to be completed. The faculty mentor will be sent a copy immediately on submission.
- An H-option contract describes the work to be completed. The faculty mentor will be sent a copy immediately on submission.
- The Honors student and faculty member should agree on a timeline; the course H-option, ideally, should be completed before finals week.

Exceptions can be made if the student is to deliver an outcome during finals week.
- Exceptions can be made if the student is to deliver an outcome during finals week.

- An H-option contract describes the work to be completed. The faculty mentor will be sent a copy immediately on submission.

- Exceptions can be made if the student is to deliver an outcome during finals week.

- If a faculty member wants to include the H-option in the syllabus, the H-option can be up to 10%of the student's grade.

10% is the maximum; 5% is the minimum.
- 10% is the maximum; 5% is the minimum.
- If a faculty member wants to use a rigorous grading methodology on the H-option, the Honors student should obtain a B or above.

- 10% is the maximum; 5% is the minimum.

- I will be preparing and submitting a piece to XYZ Art Show. This piece will be displayed and judged. I will then take the constructive feedback and reflect. Outcome: Exhibit piece at competition/reflection.

- I am an Art/English major. I will be reading poetry from XYZ author and then preparing a piece that represents this poetry. Although the one piece is the outcome for this H-option, I want to explore potential displays/exhibits where I can further my work with a second piece plus the exhibit for my next 2 H-options (maybe at the library?). Outcome: Poetry art piece.

- I will build a virtual virus and then build a physical form out of household items. Common materials might include yarn, pipe cleaners, wire, ribbon, used plastic containers, Styrofoam shapes, etc. Either provide a cut away of the capsid or take pictures at multiple steps in the process. Submit a photo and a 1-2 page (single spaced) report describing key aspects of your virus and how they may contribute to the ability to cause a pandemic.
- I will be assigned several research articles and then find several research articles throughout the semester. I will read and write a short summary of each one. The purpose is to familiarize myself with the scientific methods used. In the summary, I should identify the key points of the article and summarize them in a ”common language”.
- I am interested in dermatology. Therefore, in A&P, I will spend more time with endocrinology by researching the effects of hormones, specifically on the skin. I’m going to read journal articles and write a review paper.

- The topic of study is mammals, and hands-on experience working in the field. We plan to work with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission in Kearney, where I can volunteer to help them with deer checks for about 10 hours in total. I also plan to do an interview with one of the NGPC biologists, and then write around 3 pages about the experience and what I have learned.
- I will be observing the feral cats on the UNK campus. There is a program in place for these feral cats that involves providing shelter and water source. I will record these observations and do research on the environment impacts that feral and domestic cats have on the environment. Outcome: Observation log & analysis paper.

- I will complete a case study that is relevant to my career goals. I will apply the auditing principles and practices studies in the class to provide an analysis.
- I will be reading an audit chapter not covered in the class (a chapter with topics that I am really interested in). I will do additional discussion questions relating to this chapter and lead a short discussion in the classroom on the topics learned.
- As we covered insider trading and fraud cases alongside of mergers and acquisitions, I really wanted to get a deeper understanding. For example, how did Enron, from an accounting standpoint, get away with their fraudulent activity for so long? Were there items that would have stood out to me from an accounting standpoint? Outcome: Analysis paper of Enron and one other company.

- throughout the semester, I will be delving into historic actions taken by the Fed and examining the consequences of these actions on the economy and stock market. I will use the information we learn in Money & Banking to tie into explanations as to why actions had outcomes while noting the fiscal actions taken that boosted or hindered the goals of the Fed. I will format this information in the form of a paper that will be completed by the end of the semester. This Honors Option will deepen my economic knowledge as well as assist in my future financial decisions as I develop a more thorough understanding of why the Fed steps in when it does and historically what outcomes those actions have produced.
- I want to learn more about BitCoin and the implications of BitCoin as a currency. I will be researching how BitCoin works and analyzing BitCoin alongside of the stock market and banking system. Outcome: Analysis paper

- The H-option project I will be completing is a reflection piece. I will take what I learn in our marketing to consumers and adapt this to another culture. Outcome: Paper
- We are to find a new product, a target market for said product, and a position for the product for our final project. The outcome will essentially be to develop branding and labeling for the product that will be appealing to a specific target market. Developing the actual branding and labeling using colors and other items that are appealing is above and beyond the final project.

- I will be studying the professional relationships between businesses by conducting interviews with managers or professionals. With the answers to my questions from the interviews, I will be required to complete a minimum 2000 word paper describing the relationship between the businesses, the differences in cultures, the competitive advantages that the businesses provide each other, and making recommendations to improve the relationships.
- MGT 440: Healthcare Management I, the class is designed to the skills necessary to become an effective manager in a healthcare specific setting. The H-option portion of this contract will involve writing a paper using reputable research and journal articles with reliable sources. I am really interested in compliance and patient privacy laws and how these impact healthcare management. The paper will be around 5-7 pages with at least 8 sources (source page not counted in page count).

- I am interested in nutrition and diets. I want to look at the connection between sports drinks and digestion; I want to try to understand how sports drinks are broken down during digestion and what parts the body can use. I will be researching and reading papers and then doing a presentation in class.

- I will be writing a paper based on my observations related to language development at multiple levels. When I observe, I will take notes of the behaviors and language expressions I see and compare the students both to each other and to developmental norms as learned about in class. I will observe a toddler, preschoolers, and three elementary grade levels (1st, 3rd, and 5th grades). I will analyze their language development as we learn about the specific elements in class, and in the preschool and elementary grade levels, I will pick two students to observe and compare. I will then write a paper summarizing my findings and submit the chart I will make that outlines what I should see at each stage of development and use to compare my observations with. This will equate to 10 hours of observation, plus a paper and preparation (making the chart based on the textbook and other reliable sources).
- 1. I will be paired with a Graduate Student with a patient with a speech sound disorder. I will be required to attend a minimum of 6 sessions. 2. The Graduate Student can have me help in any way they choose. This may be collecting data or assisting in the activity.3. I will be required to journal about each session including a summary, goals, a targeted behavior, and my impressions.4. My last session will consist of completing an activity with the student as if I were the SLP. My last journal entry will reflect this session.

- Examine specific pieces of evidence and what common household cleaners may be able to partially or completely destroy traces. This will be in a lab format with 3 discussion sessions with my faculty mentor.
- I would like to incorporate ballistics to enhance my H-option from last semester. Using materials from the class I will be able to research and examine this new dimension, furthering my previous work. Outcome: presentation
- I want to research victimology in relationship to specific social and ethnic groups. I will be reviewing scholarship articles and writing a review paper. A rough draft will be due a month before finals week with a 5-page paper due during finals week.

- I want to look at different standardized testing practices in education systems in middle schools. I am specifically focusing on the US and European countries. I want to see if there is a difference in testing practice. I also want to determine what affect the test results have on students concerning future career pathways. Outcome: 6-8 page paper or presentation in class

- I will be studying the influence of literature on American political rhetoric throughout history and in modern times. This will require a thorough examination of various texts, both primary and secondary, as well as analytical thinking as I work to form connections between these texts and conclusions based upon them. The timeline will divide the semester into thirds. The first will involve reading texts assigned by the instructor that build upon the course material. During the second, I will find my own supplemental texts to work with. In the final third, I will organize the information and draw conclusions from it to build toward the final product. The final product will be a paper, and I will also present that paper to the class.
- I am studying how to craft a complete narrative in screenplay form. I will be using concepts in this class to extend the screenplay assignment from 25 pages to at least 35. I want to explore additional narrative methods
- This class covers British literature, and I would be working to compose a critical and creative piece of work that focuses on a particular reading. I am thinking of centering the project around Shakespeare's Macbeth, but am still unsure. The piece will be a paper or creative piece that centers a play.

- I am fascinated by gross anatomy and the study of cadavers. After doing the initial cadaver exercise, I will then research in-depth the disease that the cadaver had. I want to do a deep dive on the diagnosis of such a disease before death and understand what would still be present after death. I am also going to research how long the signs of a particular disease would be present after death and in what conditions. The final outcome will be a combination of lab notes, research findings and an analysis paper.
- I am fascinated by nutrition, particularly in small-town Nebraska where we have access to farmer’s markets. I want to visit and observe the produce available at the different markets and the pricing. Then I want to study the overall view on public, local health. I will also see if I can get the people (farmer’s) running the stands to complete a small questionnaire. Final outcome will be a short lit review and beginning analysis of rural-public health. I want to continue with another H-option on this project next semester.
- I am very interested in sociology of sport, particularly the topic of heroes. I will collect and read at least 10 scholarly articles on the idea of heroes in sport and summarize the findings of these research articles. I will then read at least 10 popular press articles on current sports heroes relating the research findings to what is present in today’s media. Final outcome = summarizing articles review paper and analysis/comparison paper.

- I will be looking at different archives (UNK library, Kearney library and Frank Museum). I will be interviewing the person in charge of the archives to better understand the process of archiving. I will also be doing independent research on archival processes at larger museums and libraries. In the end, I will be summarizing the archival methods/processes learned, analyzing/reflecting on the processes, providing a best practice by case on archival methods/processes. Outcome: Paper or presentation.

- Frank Lloyd Wright’s designs fascinate me. I want to look at two of Wright’s design, specifically Robie House and Fallingwater House. I want to draw the orthographic views of one of these houses with dimensions. Outcome: Poster
- I am studying the endocrine disruptive chemicals (EDCs) found in everyday products, specifically everyday interior products (furniture, materials, etc.) I will research these items, keeping shortnotes on my analyses. These findings will be incorporated into the final commercial design project. Outcome: Poster and presentation to the class.

- I will be the dramaturg for the musical theatre coaching class and be doing all the dramaturgical analysis of the songs and musicals that the class will be performing. The outcome of the H-option will be the creation of teacher preparation materials. These materials will be provided to the teachers of the students that the class will be performing for. The materials will be helpful for the teachers in leading discussion about the performance before and after their students have seen the musical theatre coaching class perform.
- I will be designing the sound for the spring dance concert. During the spring semester, I will work with the director and choreographers to meet the sound needs of the show, be prepared for all technical rehearsals, take notes and make adjustments as needed during the tech process, and ensure the sound elements of the show run smoothly during the production.

- Start developing a Virtual Dementia Tour (VDT) for Kearney. Basically, a “tour” includes participants (someone taking the tour) experiencing sensory, memory, cognitive, and other experiences like those someone with dementia experiences. *Your tasks would be: 1. Research costs and needs for developing. 2. Research whether and what materials, such as videos or other materials, require a license or membership to use. (Some established VDT’s likely have helpful materials but might require permission to use or licensure, etc.) 3. Consult and discuss options and plans with instructor. 4. Create the VDT according to instruction/plans developed with instructor. (partial; understood the whole thing will not be created in one semester). Outcome: Presentation to class.
- I will be doing a case study on an arsonist and the crime they committed. It will require research of scholarly articles and accounts of the events. It will be completed by the end of the semester. I will present my case study to the class to fulfill the requirement for an H-option class.
- I am interested in researching at-risk populations. I will be reviewing at least 10 scholarly articles, understanding methods used not only in research but to decrease conflict across groups in a prison setting. Outcome: Review paper.

- I am going to formulate a series of interview questions and then go out and interview at least 3 different social workers at different agencies. Afterwards, I will collect the interviews and write a summary, reflecting on what I observed and how it has affected the direction of my own career path.
- I will be combining my occupation as a Family Specialist at a foster care agency and my coursework in my Social Work class. I will be examining the biopsychosocial influences on the individuals desire and ability to seek mental health care. I will be combining my own perceptions on their biopsychosocial influences into wellness projects that are already established as part of the coursework. I will also include research I have reviewed on the child welfare system and how researchers in this field view mental health care.

- I will examine the impact of proximity on empathy through a survey research project. This will require critical analysis of the existing literature, as well as critical analysis of the collected data. Since this is also a URF project,  my H-option will be a written critical analysis for the outcome. A poster will be the outcome on my URF project.
- I will examine the influence of family dynamics on mental health. This multidisciplinary topic will allow me to integrate key concepts from my major/minor, and examine how these concepts play a role in my future career. This study will culminate in a 5-7 page research paper, which will be submitted the week before finals week.

- As one of the six cast members in the first of this upcoming semester's main stage shows in the theatre department, it was decided that I would write a paper as a biography for the main character, Henrietta Leavitt. While the show and the member of the cast playing her may portray her one way, this research paper would be about discovering her as she actually was, from her )me at the Harvard Observatory, to her discovery on how to judge the distance between stars, to her home life and what her actual relationships were. The main purpose of this is to see if there were any inaccuracies to her adaptation for the theatre production known as "Silent Sky" and to develop a deeper understanding of who she was, what she did, and how it affects the world of science as we know it today.
- My proposal is to create a scale model of a set designed for my chosen one act to present along with my design pitch at the end of the semester.

- After completing URF/SSRP, I will take my presentation to one regional conference and one national conference.
- After completing my research project, I will lead a peer discussion presenting my research to a small group and then taking Q&A at the end.
- During Nebraskats, I picked a piece of music, made it my own, and then led all the choreography.
- For my friend’s end recital, I was the accompanist on my primary instrument of piano. I learned 4 different pieces of music that my friend had rewritten or modified and then spent 20 hours rehearsing with my friend.

- I want to v-log (video log) unique experiences I have on this trip. Although some of my experiences will be with a group, I have three goals to experience: 1) art museum or local works; 2) ethnic delicacy; 3) local sporting or entertainment event. During each experience, I will log specific aspects such as my beginning reaction; any feelings of anxiety and why; and my end reflection. At the end of the each of the three video captures, I will also write a small reflection. I will then edit the three video captures and present them with my reflection as my final outcome.
- I want to blog experiences on my study abroad. I know nothing about blogging. I am not a web or design student. Studying blogging software options and trying at least two blogging options will be part of my H-option. While studying abroad, I will document at least 6 unique experiences that I have through words and pictures. I will present these experiences as an outcome through the blogging site, sharing the link with the Honors Program.
