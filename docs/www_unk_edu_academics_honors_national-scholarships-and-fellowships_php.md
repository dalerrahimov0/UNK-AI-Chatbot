The U.S. Student Program is designed to give recent B.S./B.A. graduates, masters and doctoral candidates, and young professionals and artists opportunities for personal development and international experience. Along with opportunities for intellectual, professional, and artistic growth, the Fulbright Program offers invaluable opportunities to meet and work with people of the host country, sharing daily life as well as professional and creative insights. The best way to appreciate others’ viewpoints, their beliefs, the way they think, and the way they do things, is to interact with them directly on an individual basis, work with them, live with them, teach with them, learn with them, and learn from them.
