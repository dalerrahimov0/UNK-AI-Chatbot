## Summer Student Research Program

### Eligibility

### Application

The Summer Student Research Program (SSRP) supports independent student research and creative activity each summer. The program is open to students from all disciplines, and is structured to enrich the educational experience in several ways.

First, SSRP enables students to engage in original research and creative activity under the guidance of a faculty mentor. This opportunity to work closely with an expert gives the student a chance to expand their knowledge of a chosen academic discipline. Secondly, because this work is independent of the structured classroom setting, students experience the excitement and challenges of applying their knowledge and skills in their chosen academic discipline. Finally, students draw on their general studies coursework and learn about other disciplines, broadening their understanding of the differences and connections between various fields of study.

The program begins in late May. Students should regularly meet with their mentors and will participate in biweekly meetings. These discussions expose students to scholarly work outside of their own discipline, foster discussions of the process or research/creative activity and give students opportunities to share their work. Meetings end by August 1, and students must complete their projects and submit a research paper (or discipline specific product) before the beginning of the new academic year. In October each year, students then present their work on posters and in oral presentations in the Fall Student Research & Creative Activity Symposium.

The next Fall Symposium is Oct. 2, 2025.

To be eligible for the 2025 SSRP, students must meet the following criteria:

Students are allowed to hold outside jobs and take summer classes, provided they do not interfere with their projects or participation in the meetings.

Students are paid $3250 ($650 per month May through September).

Mentors must be able to attend (in person) at least 25% of the weekly meetings.  They should also be able to commit to attending the Fall Research Symposium and banquet. Faculty may only mentor one student per summer through this program.

Mentors receive a stipend of $2400 ($800 in May, June and July)

The first step in the application process is to talk to faculty in your area of interest, and find a faculty member willing to be your mentor. A good place to start is the Faculty Mentor Directory. You may also contact Dr. Simon (simondm@unk.edu) directly for help. Once you reach agreement with this mentor, work with them to complete the application form.

So that you can begin preparing your application, the form will ask you for contact information, a project description, an essay from the student, and a letter of support from the mentor. Please note that faculty may not mentor more than one student each summer. We also ask the student to declare their other summer commitments.

Applications are due February 20, 2026.

Students can apply via NU Ramp by selecting “IC Application” (under “Quick Add Actions”) and then “Summer Student Research Program (SSRP) – Summer 2026” from the drop down menu. In the application students will be asked to include a description of the project and a short essay describing why they want to join the program. After submission, faculty will be asked for a letter of support and a description of summer plans that would affect their ability to participate in the program.
