### Admissions Resources

Your BOLD future starts here. UNK is a best value, top-10 ranked Public Midwest University with academic excellence from expert faculty, hands-on experiences, and research opportunities. Combined with leadership opportunities, internships, study abroad and more, our graduates are career ready.

First-Time Freshman

Freshmen include students who are graduating high school seniors or high school graduates (or equivalent, e.g., homeschool or GED) who have never attended a college or university. If a student earned college credits while in high school through early entry or dual enrollment, they will still be considered a first-time freshman.

Transfer to UNK

Students who have earned college credit at another institution after high school (or equivalent, e.g., homeschool or GED) are considered transfer students. Students who previously attended UNK but have since earned college credit at another institution should apply to UNK as a transfer student. If the only college credit earned was while in high school (prior to graduation), students are first-time freshmen.

International Student

You’re an international student if you are currently studying or planning to study in the United States on a temporary student (F or J) visa.

Return to UNK

Students who have not been enrolled at the University of Nebraska at Kearney within the last two years are required to apply for readmission through the Office of Admissions. Application should be made at least four weeks prior to the beginning of the term to which readmission is requested. Students who have attended UNK at any time within the last two years and who wish to enroll in classes may register for classes according to the scheduled registration times posted by the Registrar's Office.

- A former student attending another college or university is considered a transfer student and must satisfy transfer requirements. Complete transcripts of credit earned at other institutions should be filed with the Office of Admissions.
- Students voluntarily withdrawing are eligible for readmission with the same admission status that existed at the time of withdrawal.
- Students suspended or dismissed for academic reasons should contact Academic Advising and Career Development for first steps. The process for evaluation for readmission usually includes considering academic aptitude, evidence of growth and maturity, course work at other institutions, and time elapsed since leaving the institution.
