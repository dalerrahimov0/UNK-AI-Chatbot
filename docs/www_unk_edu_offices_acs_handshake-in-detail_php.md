Start with completing the profile sections or uploading your resume. Should you upload a resume, you can choose to pull information from your resume directly from the document into your system profile, including: work experience, extra-curricular activities, and skills.  Be sure to check the details to make sure everything is correctly listed in your profile. Importantly, most employers search for candidates based on skill sets, so be sure to add  a thorough list of your skills to your profile.

Once you’ve completed the “profile” section, click the “account” tab  and  specify your job interests. These details will be very important for you to receive communications about jobs, internships, upcoming events and other important details related to your personal and career development.

Make sure your profile is as complete as possible by providing information in the Account/Job Interests section, including:  location, industry, job function and job interests.

Opt to make your profile “public” so that employers will be able to see your full profile page, including: all of the information in the Education, Work Experience, Extracurricular, Projects, External Links, Courses, Organizations, and Skills sections. If you make your profile public, remember that an employer can see ALL of your information. Please proofread your resume, proofread your profile, and proofread any message you send to a potential employer.

List external links on your profile that represent you and your work in a positive and professional light. These may include your LinkedIn profile, a work/project portfolio, or any video and web projects, etc.

Once you have completed your profile and provided information about your background and job interests, you can begin searching for opportunities. Here’s how:
