REQUEST A LOPER BIKE

The first step to renting a bike is to fill out a bike request form and a user agreement. Once submitted and payment is received, a staff member from Campus Recreation will reach out to you to arrange a time to pick up your bike.

You can pick up your bike at the Wellness Center. Contact 308-865-1732 to arrange your pick up time. At pick up, a Campus Recreation staff member will review the rental agreement as well as the features of the bike.

The cost will be $50 per semester (fall or spring) and $90 for an academic year rental. An additional $50 fee is available for a summer semester rental. Helmets are available for an additional rental cost of $5 per semester. Bike locks are included in the fee and riders will be given a key for their lock.

If you suspect something might be wrong with your bike please contact the campus recreation office. We can arrange a time to have your bike evaluated. Any service which is normal maintenance will be at no cost to the user. Any service that is beyond normal maintenance or is believed to be caused by wrongful doing will be charged to the user.

More information can be found on the Campus Recreation web page unk.edu/loperbike

Any current UNK student or Faculty/staff is eligible.

No, riders may commute with the bikes if they would like and keep the bikes locked securely at their place of residence. However, bikes should be locked in a secure location as the rider is responsible for the whereabouts of their rented bike at all times.

Contact the Campus Recreation office 308-865-1732 or email loperbikes@unk.edu

Contact Campus Recreation immediately at 308-865-1732. If you suspect that the bike was stolen, contact UNK Police 308-865-8911.

Riders will be responsible for the cost of the bike. Details are outlined in the rental agreement.

Riders will be able to use existing bike racks throughout campus.

You can reserve a bike and chose to keep it in storage until you are ready to use it. You can speak to a Campus Recreation staff about this during the review of the rental agreement.
