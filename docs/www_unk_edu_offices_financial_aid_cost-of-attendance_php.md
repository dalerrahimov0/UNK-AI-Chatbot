## Cost of Attendance

### What’s Included

Your cost of attendance is the amount it will cost for you to go to UNK. To estimate your specific cost of attendance, we recommend using UNK's Cost Calculator. Please note that the Cost Calculator will only calculate your direct costs, or items charged by UNK.

The Office of Financial Aid uses a “standard cost of attendance budget” to calculate your estimated educational costs before scholarships, aid, or discounts, including the New Nebraskan Scholarship. The chart below represents typical costs for students during the nine-month academic year based on anticipated enrollment, residency status, and living arrangements (on campus, off campus or with parents). The amounts below represent the average cost of attendance for the 2024-2025 academic year.

*These are estimates based on average reported expenses of UNK students.
