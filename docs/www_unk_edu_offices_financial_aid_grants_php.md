## Grants

A grant is a form of free money given for higher education. It is financial aid from the federal government, state government, or UNK that is given to students with financial need. To be considered for grants, students must complete their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).Most grants are only applicable to fall and spring semesters, but in some cases the Pell Grant may be applied to the summer semester (depending on eligibility). Most grants require students to be enrolled full-time (12+ credit hours). Only undergraduate, first bachelor's degree-seeking students can receive grants. Graduate, endorsement-seeking, or initial certification/transition to teaching students are not eligible to receive most grants (exception is the TEACH grant – see more information below). Grant funding is tentative each year based on funding availability.All students are limited to a lifetime eligibility of Pell Grant, which is the equivalent of six full-time years. A student may view their eligibility online by logging into the studentaid.gov website with their FSA ID. This website acts as a data system for all federal student aid and keeps track of lifetime Pell Grant usage and federal loan borrowing history from any institution.See the chart below for an explanation of the different grants you may see on your financial aid offer:
