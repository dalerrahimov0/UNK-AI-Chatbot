The University of Nebraska at Kearney offers a scholarship to all out-of-state undergraduate students so they will pay the in-state tuition rate. With the New Nebraskan Scholarship, non-resident students will receive a discount to save up to $31,680 on tuition over a 4-year period, matching in-state tuition rates.

With the New Nebraskan Scholarship, non-resident undergraduate students will pay the in-state rate to attend UNK. There is no application for the New Nebraskan Scholarship; you only need to apply to UNK and the scholarship will be added to your financial aid offer.

“In-state tuition has made a WORLD OF DIFFERENCE. It costs just as much or less than other institutions back home. This has provided me the chance to experience something outside of Kansas and grow. It has been so easy to transition from Kansas to Kearney. The faculty and staff at UNK makes it FEEL LIKE HOME, and the education quality has been outstanding.”

Beginning in the fall 2021 semester, the New Nebraskan scholarship waives the difference between out-of-state and in-state tuition charges. Non-residents from another state will pay the same tuition rate as Nebraska residents.

Any U.S. domestic undergraduate student who is not a resident of Nebraska and enrolls as a full-time student (12 or more credit hours per semester) in a traditional degree program at UNK is eligible.

It applies only for online classes for student enrolled in traditional degree programs. Non-Nebraska residents who enroll in an exclusively online degree program will not be eligible for the New Nebraskan Scholarship.

The scholarship will save non-resident students $264 per credit hour. Most bachelor’s degrees at UNK require 120 credit hours. This saves students $7,920 annually or $31,680 over a 4-year period.

No. The scholarship will waive the difference between out-of-state and in-state tuition cost and is applied to your account. A student will never receive a cash refund from the award.

Yes. Beginning in the fall 2021 semester, all non-resident upperclassmen will receive a waiver between the non-resident and resident tuition charge.

Current students receiving the Non-Resident, Colorado & Kansas Advantage, Loper Legacy or Loper Heritage will retain these scholarships only if they are in on-line programs through UNK Online. If they are enrolled in programs that are traditionally delivered, their scholarships will be replaced with the New Nebraskan scholarship. The Non-Resident Scholarship, Colorado & Kansas Advantage Scholarship, Loper Heritage Scholarship and Legacy Scholarship will be phased out over time as recipients leave school or graduate.

Students will see the New Nebraskan Scholarship listed in their financial aid award on MyBLUE.

Eligibility for this scholarship will end upon receipt of a bachelor’s degree.

Students must be full-time (12 or more credit hours per semester) and successfully complete 24 or more credit hours each academic year. Scholarship eligibility expires after receipt of a bachelor’s degree or after eight semesters, whichever comes first.
