## Safe Walk

Are you concerned for your safety?

Did you work or study into the late hours?

Is it dark and you are walking along back to your car or home?

Safe Walk may be the answer!

The University of Nebraska at Kearney is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for the campus community. Anytime a student, employee or visitor feels uncomfortable walking on, or within two blocks of campus, they can request a SAFE WALK. Simply dial (308) 865-8911 and speak to a UNK Officer.

They will ask the following information:

They will then arrange to meet with you and escort you to a safe location. Officers will walk with you two blocks off campus, south, east and north for those of you parking or living nearby. The Safe Walk is available every night from 9:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. If you ever feel uncomfortable on campus before or after these hours, contact UNK Police at (308) 865-8911 and an Officer will escort you to your safe destination.
