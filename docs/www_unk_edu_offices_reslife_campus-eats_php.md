At UNK, we believe that great food fuels great minds. This is why we offer a variety of delicious, nutritious, and convenient meal choices to suit every taste and lifestyle. Whether you're grabbing a quick coffee between classes, enjoying a meal with friends, or exploring diverse cuisines, our dining services are designed to nourish your body and energize your day. With fresh ingredients, sustainable practices, and welcoming spaces, dining on campus is more than a meal—it's an experience. Join us and make every bite count!

All students who live on campus must select a meal plan option. These plans are designed to fit your lifestyle at reasonable costs.

All-you-care-to-eat at The Graze. Visit as often as you want until meals are exhausted. To-go options are also available, featuring made-from-scratch dining with the convenience of take-out.

Dining Dollars can be used at retail locations like Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, Subway, Java Notes, and The Grid. No need to carry cash or bring a debit card. Just scan your student ID which is pre-loaded with Dining Dollars, until the funds run out.

For your convenience and simplicity, all freshmen have one meal plan option. This ensures freshmen will have access to a meal for every meal period and can explore all food options during the semester.260 Block Meals | $450 Dining Dollars | $2,922/semester (less than $11 per meal!)
