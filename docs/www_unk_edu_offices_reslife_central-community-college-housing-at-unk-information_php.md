Students have busy schedules, so forget about meal prep and dishes. Choose from one of these flexible Meal Plans with a designated number of visits to the main dining centers, as well as dollars for campus restaurants and coffee shops, all within walking distance.

Block Meals – Use your Block Meals at the Graze located upstairs in the Student Union. Visit as often as you want until meals are exhausted. If you want to enjoy the made-from-scratch cooking in the dining hall with the convenience of take-out, ask about the To Go program. This is an all you care to eat option.

Dining Dollars- Use at retail options such as Chick-Fil-A, Starbucks, and Subway to enhance your experiences on campus.

Meal Plan Requirement Please note: All students who live in the residence halls during the academic year (fall and spring semesters) are required to select a meal plan option. Board plans are optional during the summer term only. View more information on Meal Plans.
