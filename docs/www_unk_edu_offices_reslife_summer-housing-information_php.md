Summer Housing is designed for UNK students enrolled in at least one summer class or participating in internships/research in Kearney over the summer months.  Summer term is from May 20th through August 8th for the 2025.  We have limited spaces available for summer housing as we assign spaces in the order we receive the contact. We do offer later move-in options to help you reduce the cost of summer, but spaces are based on availability.  The latest move-in date we offer is June 30th.  Checkout is allowed at any time. The latest checkout date is August 8th, 2025.

To request a space in summer housing, please make sure to fill out the summer housing contract in MyBlue by May 2nd 2025.

*We do offer a promotional special for students wanting to live in our upperclassman residence halls under our 365 housing contract, but those spaces are limited and only available to returning students signed up to live in Martin, Armstrong, Nester, and Antelope during the upcoming school year. If you feel you qualify for that option, please reach out to us at housing@unk.edu and we will see if space is available.

Please read the Summer Housing Agreement before completing the Summer Housing Application.
