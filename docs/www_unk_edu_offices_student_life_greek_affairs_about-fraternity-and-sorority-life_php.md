Each of our organizations have their own rituals, traditions, and areas of focus, but all strive to live by the four core values of scholarship, leadership, service, and friendship.

Scholarship: Helping students reach their academic goals and graduating with a college degree.

Leadership: Extend additional opportunities for the development of critical transferable leadership and life skills, like critical thinking, working across difference, prioritization, time management, effective communication, event planning, and organization.

Service: Giving back to others locally and globally through time, talent, and treasure.

Friendship: Create connections, network, elevate community, and foster a sense of belonging for all who participate in Fraternity and Sorority Life.

The Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life is comprised of full time staff, graduate assistant(s), and student worker(s) that provide support for the community’s operations.

Advance the fraternity and sorority life experience at UNK through education and advisement. The office is committed to providing opportunities for personal and professional development, community engagement, and cultivation of co-curricular experiences that enhances a student-centered learning environment.

Through values-driven and inclusive practices, we aim to create a community of leaders that challenge societal norms and foster a collaborative spirit where students matter, feel valued, are holistically supported, and belong.
