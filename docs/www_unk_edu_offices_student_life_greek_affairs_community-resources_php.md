## Current Leader Resources

#### Council Governing Documents

Our community strives to be leaders in and outside of the classroom. We want to make accessing the tools and information necessary to make values-based decisions more centrally located for our current community leaders.

Forms and DocumentsAll forms and documents needed for current leaders to be successful are linked to the Fraternity and Sorority Life LoperLinks Page.

Council Governing Documents and Organization ApplicationsAll governing council documentation, leadership applications, etc. are linked within each council or organization’s Presence Page.

Community Leader Resource FolderThe Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life has created a folder of curated resources that may be too ‘live’ to live statically on the Fraternity and Sorority Life website and Presence Page. You can access the folder here.

Note: this folder is password protected and can be obtained from your chapter or council president if you do not have access to it.

Office ProceduresUtilize the Fraternity and Sorority Life Operations Manual to understand how to be an effective leader, meet expectations, and follow the processes and procedures needed to navigate our community’s operating system.
