While you may not be a UNK student anymore, you will always be a part of our UNK and fraternity and sorority family and community. Fraternity and sorority membership is a life-long experience and UNK has a successful, thriving Greek community with volunteers, chapter members, and University representatives who are actively engaged in promoting the fraternity and sorority experience. As a valued alumnus or alumna, we want  YOU to stay connected and involved with UNK and the Fraternity & Sorority Life community. Here are a few ways that you can continue to engage and support our community at your alma mater.

UNK alumni can give back to their alma mater after graduation in numerous ways. The UNK Alumni Association is a great place to start to determine how you can stay connected, no matter where you are located.

Due to the nature of fraternities and sororities, alumni of our chapters also have the privilege of staying connected to individual organizations by joining an alumni chapter for the organization itself. To get reconnected to your chapter, please email fsl@unk.edu and we can connect you.

Many alumni choose to support their chapter by volunteering their time and expertise to the current members of an undergraduate chapter. The advisor roles, positions, and commitments for each chapter vary greatly, so please contact your organization directly if you are interested. The UNK Fraternity & Sorority Life Office can also help connect you with the respective advisory board or chapter. There are opportunities for both local and remote advisory roles.

As an advisor or organization volunteer, we expect that you:

While we wish you could always be here with us in Kearney, we will settle for highlighting a couple main events to “come home” for.

Invest in the future of the fraternity and sorority community at UNK. By donating to UNK Fraternity & Sorority Life or other Greek-specific funds, we are able to continue to create special and impactful experiences for current UNK students. These funds go directly to educational programming and student scholarships of fraternity and sorority leaders as they pursue their academic and professional goals.

Donate To The Greek Experience

- Are aware of and understand guidelines and policies pertaining to UNK student organizations, UNK’s fraternity and sorority chapters, and the University.
- Serve as a resource for planning events and programs, resolving issues confronting the group, and orientating new members and officers. Be aware of liability issues (i.e. hazing, alcohol, etc.) on the local and national level and advise the organization to make reasonable and prudent decisions when planning activities.
- Promote the ongoing function of the organization by attending meetings of the group, connecting with chapter officers for advice or consultation, reviewing meeting minutes, and being knowledgeable of the organization's constitution, bylaws, financial status, etc.
- Attend periodic meetings of organizational advisors, and work in partnership with University staff, chapter advisors, and national headquarters to foster a positive fraternal experience for the undergraduate members.

- Homecoming is always an exciting, action-packed time for campus, and an excellent occasion to revisit campus. Each individual chapter often hosts events for their alumni in town. The Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life plans to host a gathering during the 2024 Homecoming Weekend to welcome the community to our new living and learning spaces.
- If you are ever in town, don’t be a stranger! Stop by the chapter houses and connect with current members or come to the Fraternity & Sorority Life office in the Student Union to hear about current happenings in the community.
