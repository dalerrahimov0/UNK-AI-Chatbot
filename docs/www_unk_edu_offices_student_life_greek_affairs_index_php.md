The University of Nebraska at Kearney is home to six sororities and six fraternities that are instrumental in cultivating a dynamic and educational collegiate experience for students. Members are involved and leaders across campus, take on service projects that benefit the campus and Kearney community, excel academically, and build life-long connections to benefit them while at UNK and beyond.

If you are looking to find your home at UNK and make your time here exceptional, the Fraternity and Sorority community is the place for YOU!

The University of Nebraska at Kearney has a successful, thriving Greek community with volunteers, chapter members, and University representatives who are actively engaged in promoting these chapters.

The Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life is located on the first floor of the Student Union in Suite 142.

Interested in joining or just learning more about fraternity and sorority life at UNK? Fill out our interest form to be connected with a current FSL student. They will be able to answer all of your questions and share about their experience! Expressing interest does not obligate you to join a fraternity or sorority.

“I would tell people that are unsure about fraternity and sorority life that college is a new environment and it’s all about coming in with an open mind and just trying to be involved in as many things as possible. If you want to meet new people. FSL is an amazing way to do that.”
