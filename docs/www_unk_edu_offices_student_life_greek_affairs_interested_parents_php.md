Your loved one is embarking on a new and exciting journey here at UNK, with numerous opportunities to establish new friendships, cultivate memorable moments, and celebrate future accomplishments. However, being in a new environment can be intimidating. Those new to a college campus often feel overwhelmed once they step onto campus.

Numerous studies indicate that student retention and persistence to graduation is impacted by the connection they feel to their campus environment. By joining a fraternity or sorority, your loved one will have the opportunity to meet many new and committed students, and their membership will begin to deepen their connection to campus immediately. Additionally, fraternity and sorority alumni report a greater sense of wellbeing in their career, community, finances, physicality, and social aspects compared to non-affiliated college alumni.

As a parent, guardian, or family member, we want  YOU to be an active partner in your loved one’s fraternity or sorority experience by becoming familiar with the community and supporting your student along the way. The Fraternity and Sorority Life Office is a resource to you as you learn more or have questions.

Here are a few ways that you can support your loved one as they begin and maintain their fraternity or sorority membership.

For those unfamiliar with fraternity and sorority life at UNK, here are a few commonly asked questions.

Our 12 chapters fall under the umbrella of three governing councils including the Interfraternity Council (IFC), Multicultural Greek Council (MGC), and the Panhellenic Council (PC). Each organization is affiliated with a inter/national organization and is recognized by UNK as a registered student organization.

You can learn more about each council and chapter by learning more about our community.

Fraternities and sororities are rooted in founding principles that foster academic achievement, student involvement, community service, and life-long friendships. Advantages include:

A support group to help ease the adjustment to college.

Scholastic resources to help students achieve their academic goals.

Leadership skills acquired through hands-on experience.

Encouragement to get involved, stay involved and maximize their potential on campus.

Opportunities for active participation in community service projects.

Our members realize that academic achievement is the main priority of UNK Students. Greek-letter organizations continue to strive for academic excellence and promote scholarship by providing academic resources for their members. These include:

There is a financial commitment associated with joining a fraternity or sorority. This financial obligation is best considered as an investment into one's fraternity and sorority life experience. The costs go toward the inter/national fees, insurance, chapter operating expenses, events, and social functions. Financial obligations differ among individual chapters.

New members can expect to pay higher dues their first semester than in subsequent ones. While your loved one is participating in the recruitment process, make sure that they ask about the financial obligations of membership.

For IFC fraternities, dues will range from $400 - $500 for the first semester. For the semesters to follow, dues will range from $325 - $500.

For Multicultural fraternities and sororities, the prices range and will be explained during an informational session.

For Panhellenic sororities, the average dues are $575 for the first semester. For the semesters to follow, the average dues are $400.

Note: Specific prices are subject to change based on the economy and each individual chapter’s goals and priorities.



One of the biggest highlights for our fraternity and sorority life students is the ability to live in our on-campus fraternity and sorority living spaces. Currently, we have housing for all our Interfraternity (IFC) and Panhellenic (PC) chapters. These spaces are owned by UNK and operated by the Office of Residence Life. This means all billing for living in the chapter housing is conveniently included in your MyBlue bill. The room and board rates are set through Residence Life and are billed separately from chapter operating dues and fees.

First year students typically reside elsewhere on campus, and then move into their fraternity or sorority chapter house at the start of their second year. Most chapters have requirements for residing in the chapter house for one to two years, but students tend to see it as a privilege more than an expectation.

Martin Hall, fraternity housing, opened in January 2023. The building housing sorority and MGC living and meeting spaces is planned for occupancy in January 2024.

The University of Nebraska at Kearney, and most inter/national fraternity and sororities have a zero-tolerance policy regarding hazing that is consistent with the Nebraska State Laws and the Student Code of Conduct. If you sense your student may be participating in inappropriate activities as a result of membership in a fraternity or sorority, you should contact the Fraternity and Sorority Life Office at 308-865-8057. Calls will be handled in an immediate and discrete manner.

One of the best parts about fraternity and sorority life at UNK is that our students can be involved in several other areas across campus simultaneously. Not only does this give students valuable exposure to different areas of interest, but it helps teach the important life skills of time management and organization. Often times our organizations actually require their members to be involved in other things on campus to ensure a well-rounded college experience.

FSL students are encouraged to get involved and are often seen in athletic teams, band, dance/cheer team, academic clubs, student government, campus tour guides, Chancellor’s Ambassadors, and beyond. Being in a fraternity or sorority is often an excellent gateway to other opportunities on campus, as older members can help get new students connected to groups that meet their interests or goals.

The fraternity and sorority life community offers students unique social opportunities that connect them to peers and enrich their college experience. Activities are wide-ranging, but some popular events include:

Attendance at all events is not required, but the opportunity provides a nice balance for students as they work hard academically.

- Maintain connections and check in on them, ensure that they are having a meaningful experience. If something doesn’t feel right, encourage them to seek help.
- Attend events, when you’re able. Having a loved one participate in their experience can mean a lot.
- Ask questions and show your interest in their experience. Even if fraternity or sorority wasn’t your experience, encouraging how it can continue to positively your loved can make the difference in their college experience.
- Don’t impart your collegiate experience on your loved one. Whether or not fraternity or sorority was a part of your experience, allow your loved one to navigate their own journey and make meaning of the experiences that they need to learn and grow.
