Loper Programming and Activities Council, a student-run group, plans some of the most exciting and popular events on campus including the spring concert, Lip Sync competition, Gingerbread House Competition and bingo nights.

Interested in being part of the group? Membership in LPAC is open to any UNK student. The group meets at 5 pm on Thursdays inside the Antelope Room in the Nebraskan Student Union.

With graham crackers as siding and frosting as mortar, student teams show off their design skills at the annual LPAC Gingerbread House Competition.

LPAC Stuff-A-Plush is a fun activity hosted by LPAC members the past few years. Check in with LoperLinks and receive your favorite stuffed animal. In fact, stuff your own favorite stuffed animal...hence the name. This is also a great wellness and self-care activity. Whether you decide to keep the stuffed animal or give it to a friend, it is a great opportunity for wellness and connectedness.

This event is a great way to meet new people and get a little exercise while supporting UNK's Student Leadership Scholarship fund.

The Fun 5K Walk/Run, which is open to anyone, regularly attracts 400 to 500 participants and raises thousands of dollars for student scholarships. Participants receive a T-shirt and there are drawings for prizes donated by sponsors.
