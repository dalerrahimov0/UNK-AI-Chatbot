Students play a major role in ensuring that the UNK experience is unforgettable. At UNK, student government is highly involved in all aspects of the university, including student life, academics, and policies.

Much like the federal government, student government is comprised of an executive branch, legislative branch, and judicial branch. Each is charged with specific roles and responsibilities, and the students who serve on them take their job in that role seriously. These are students you know; they are your friends, roommates, classmates, study partners, and teammates. This means that you can depend on them to ensure your voice is heard.

The executive branch is comprised of six cabinet members -- student body president, vice president, chief of staff, secretary of the treasury, secretary of student organizations and affairs, and secretary of community relations.

The president is the official student body representative to the administration and public and represents UNK as a student member of the University of Nebraska Board of Regents. He or she has the power to pass or veto legislation passed by the Senate.

The cabinet, chaired by the vice president, consists of the four constitutionally enumerated officers and other directors, advisers and support staff.

The Senate is the legislature of the student body. Students are elected to the Senate from each of UNK's three undergraduate colleges and the University of Nebraska graduate college. There are also freshman senators and deciding/preprofessional student senators.

The Senate has the power to pass legislation for the campus, approve new student organizations, appoint student representatives to Faculty Senate and other administrative committees, and perform any other duties concerning student issues or concerns.

The Senate meets at 5:30 p.m. Tuesdays in the Antelope Room of the Nebraskan Student Union. Meetings, which are open to anyone, are held weekly during the school year, except during finals week.

For more information, call the Student Engagement Office at 308-865-8523.
